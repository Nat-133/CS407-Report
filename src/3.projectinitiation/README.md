# Project Initiation
Related to the reasons for the project, what it hopes to achieve and clarification of scope. These sections should be fairly brief! Should not include specifics of our implementation.

## Motivation - Why?
What is the justification for the project's existence. What purpose does it serve and which gap does it fill? Are there potential benefits unexplored currently by the project? Link back to background.

## Aims - What?
Given the motivations what are we planning to make and how does it address motivations?

## Scope - What its not.
Define project boundaries. What is beyond the scope of the project that might be unclear in aims.
