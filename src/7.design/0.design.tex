\chapter{Design}
There are two fundamental parts to the design, the first being integration of GPI into the existing codebase, and secondly the architecture of the new GPI software. The following sections will outline the constraints and considerations of both modifying the underlying memory architecture in OP2, using GPI in an existing MPI environment and present two designs. 

%Can just say briefly what they cover and why they're important?
